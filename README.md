599CD AppleTV App

Initially this app has a few of the Beginner Level 1 Courses, I'm hoping to add the Tips videos too.

Ultimately I'd like to have a link to a user's account so you can watch all your couses.

## Download

Go to your Apple TV and head to the Search bar

Search for **599CD** and download and enjoy :)
